# Candidate Discovery Questions (Executive Roles)

Use these prompts to assess strategic capability, cultural alignment, and readiness for client needs (CPO, CMO, CFO, CISO, GTM, etc.).

1. **Strategic Alignment** — Which company stage (startup, scale‑up, enterprise, PE/VC) do you impact most, and why?
2. **Leadership Philosophy** — How has your leadership style evolved in the last 3–5 years?
3. **Functional Achievements** — Which outcomes best demonstrate measurable impact in your discipline?
4. **Transformation Experience** — Describe a major transformation you led (e.g., GTM shift, product overhaul, restructuring, M&A). Key lessons?
5. **Board / Stakeholder Management** — How do you manage alignment when interests conflict?
6. **Data & Decisions** — How do you balance data‑driven decisions with intuition at executive level?
7. **Culture & People** — What culture enables your best performance? What culture have you built successfully?
8. **EMEA Exposure** — Which EMEA markets have you operated in, and what networks/insights do you bring?
9. **Motivation & Readiness** — What motivates you now (growth, transformation, innovation, stability)?
10. **Risk Appetite** — Which challenges energize you, and what would make you hesitate about a role?

> Tip: Follow with role‑specific probes (e.g., CPO: discovery cadence, roadmap ROI; CMO: demand mix, brand vs. performance; CFO: cash flow, controls, fundraising; CISO: risk frameworks, incident playbooks; GTM: coverage, enablement, win‑rate drivers).

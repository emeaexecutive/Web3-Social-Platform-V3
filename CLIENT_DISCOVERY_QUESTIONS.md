# Client Discovery Questions (Executive Hiring)

Use these prompts during intake to surface strategic needs, success metrics, and cultural fit across roles (CPO, CMO, CFO, CISO, GTM, etc.).

1. **Strategic Priorities** — What are the top 3 strategic goals for the next 12–18 months, and how does this role contribute?
2. **Leadership Fit** — Which leadership style and cultural traits are critical on your executive team right now?
3. **Functional Excellence** — For this role, which specific capabilities or track record are non‑negotiable?
4. **Transformation vs. Steady-State** — Is this leader maintaining momentum or driving major change (scale-up, turnaround, M&A)?
5. **Board / Investor Expectations** — How will your board or investors define success at 6–12 months?
6. **Market / Sector Relevance** — Must candidates come from your sector, or is cross‑industry experience valuable?
7. **EMEA Footprint** — What regional experience or networks across EMEA will matter most?
8. **KPIs & Outcomes** — Which KPIs will determine first‑year success?
9. **Team Context** — What team will they inherit, and what shift do you want them to drive?
10. **Risks & Red Flags** — What are the biggest risks of a mis‑hire in this seat?

> Tip: After this core set, add role‑specific depth (e.g., product velocity and discovery for CPO; pipeline, CAC/LTV, and segmentation for CMO; cash, runway, and controls for CFO; risk posture and incident readiness for CISO; coverage model and win‑rate for GTM).
